# Feel free to use at your convenience
# This project was created to convert dita files into csv for database upload
# The assumption is that we are interestd in elements with inner text only and that the entries should include tag, text and attributes
# xml2csv is a rough draft in procedural programming
# xmlconverter is a more object oriented approach, more suitable for re-use in other projects
# Both will scan a folder for all dita or xml file and convert them into csv files
# Enjoy
